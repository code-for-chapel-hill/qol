# Quality of Life Platform

## Project Background
This repository is for work associated with creating a Quality of Life Platform for The Town of Chapel Hill. The Town of Chapel Hill would like to have a public facing platform to visualize various quality of life data assets but does not currently have anything in development. An initial set of data assets has not been identified but prototyping will most likely include publicly available data before moving to a more robust set of data assets from The Town of Chapel Hill. 

The current intention for this project is for it to be written in R as a Shiny application. If desired, consideration can be given to using Docker to containerize this application for easy deployment.

## Wishlist Notes
Items that are currently needed will appear under Needed and completed items will be moved under Completed.

### Needed
* Documentation for a QOL metadata standard which will define how data assets should be documented
* Documentation for a QOL data standard which will define how data should be structured
* List of initially desired data assets with documentation
* Easily repeatable data processing script for multi-year Census data
* Shiny application skeleton prototype

### Completed
